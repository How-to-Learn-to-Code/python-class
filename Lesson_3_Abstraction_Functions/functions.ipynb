    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction is a core concept in programming; it's the idea of taking something complex and assigning it a simpler and more reusable form. You've already learned about a form of abstraction in lessons 1 and 2: variables. When you assign a string, number, list, etc. to a variable you're separating the item (the data in the variable) from the accession (the variable name). \n",
    "\n",
    "This same idea can be applied to processes; these are called functions. Functions allow you to execute a series of commands using a single execution call and can be written to process multiple inputs by being called multiple times. \n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction is a fundamentally difficult concept to grasp in programming, so don't feel bad if it takes a bit to wrap your head around.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivating Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a common training task: building a calculator that can do the following with two numbers:\n",
    "    - Add\n",
    "    - Subtract\n",
    "    - Multiply \n",
    "    - Divide\n",
    "    - Calculate an exponent (raise the first number to the power of the second)\n",
    "\n",
    "We choose this because it is straightforward to understand, has a clear requirement for inputs/outputs, and is easily testable. You already learned how to do all of these mathematical operations, so the only novel concept will be related to building and running functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pseudocode\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing functions it's important to think about 3 things:\n",
    "  - What does my function need to do? *or* What output should my function return?\n",
    "  - What input does it require?\n",
    "  - What steps need to happen to go from input to output?\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing out these requirements and steps in natural language is an organized and efficient way to understand your function before writing it, which makes the creation and testing easier. This is called *pseudocode* because it is not code but explains the logic behind a section of code that's organized in the same way as the code itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how I would write these notes for our calculator example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input**: \n",
    "  - Mathematical operation\n",
    "  - Number 1\n",
    "  - Number 2\n",
    "- **Output**: \n",
    "  - Resulting value from operation\n",
    "- **Process (pseudocode)**:\n",
    "  - Check for inputted operation\n",
    "  - Calculate the operation using two inputted values\n",
    "  - Return resulting value\n",
    "\n",
    "### First example\n",
    "\n",
    "With that, let's write our first, and simplest, form of a function: a function to add two numbers.\n"

    "- `return result`, which tells the function that it's done everything it needs to and what value(s) to give to the global scope (more on that later). Whatever value(s) are returned can then be set as a variable when you call the function, as you'll see in the next block of code. \n",
