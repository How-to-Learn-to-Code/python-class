This can be as small as how many new lines you have between code lines, to the way you comment your code, and how you name your variables. Matching a standard style of code will help make your code more readable and more reproducible. If you continue your coding journey, we recommend the [PEPS Style Guide for Python](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008).
